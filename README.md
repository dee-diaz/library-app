## Learning Focus

This project started as a procedural JavaScript application and was refactored to use modern OOP principles and modular architecture. The refactor demonstrates:

- Migration from prototype-based to ES6 class syntax
- Implementation of private class fields and proper encapsulation
- Event delegation to prevent memory leaks
- Modular code organization with clear dependencies
- Separation of concerns (Book, Storage, UI, Form, Modal, Manager)
